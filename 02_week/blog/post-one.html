            <p>React stays the most popular JavaScript framework. This text covers the most recent tips about wringing probably the most efficiency from the React framework, together with useful elements and the Suspense function.
            React works by sustaining an in-memory mannequin of the view (usually known as a digital DOM) that’s used to find out if and when the precise DOM must be up to date.</p>
            <p>Manipulating the precise DOM is pricey, so many efficiency enhancements revolve round making certain that modifications to the DOM happen solely when completely essential.</p>
            <p>We’ll have a look at a number of of those DOM-oriented methods right here, with variations for useful and class-based elements, together with some extra normal ideas. 
            When writing class-based elements, you possibly can override the shouldComponentUpdate() lifecycle technique. The aim of this technique is to explicitly declare whether or not the part requires re-rendering. To reiterate, rendering is the costly a part of the lifecycle whereby the precise DOM is up to date. React solely renders if a part’s props or state have modified, however typically you possibly can skip even this, avoiding calling render in any respect.
            The signature and motion of shouldComponentUpdate is easy. Itemizing 1 has a primary instance. The thought right here is that you realize your part and you’ll specify these situations the place it ought to and mustn’t replace. The tactic receives the incoming props and state as arguments. If the tactic returns true, the part will render, in any other case it is not going to.
